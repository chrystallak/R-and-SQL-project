# R-and-SQL-project

I and my team worked on creating a database for Axe brand on PostgreSQL, populated it with the relative data and used SQL queries and R coding to analyze the data and develop an interactive dashboard on Domo. 

Project Instructions

Scope
Assume you are a team of database experts hired by a client
Your client has a lot of archived, unstructured data that they need to have organized for easy access and analysis
Your client also has new data coming in that need to be automatically stored and efficiently retrieved
Your client requires two levels of access to the data:
Analysts: write and execute SQL code as well as access the database through Python/R
Managers/C-executives: high-level overview through visualizations and interactive dashboards that automatically update when new data is stored in the database

Overview
Your team will have to propose a scenario
Find data relevant to the scenario. There is no specific limit but small datasets or pre-defined relational datasets are not appropriate. The main requirement is that unnormalized data should result in at least 15 tables at 3NF.
Develop a relational schema and load data (Python/R can automate the loading process)
Demonstrate the efficiency of the relational database by showcasing at least 10 analytical procedures that led to valuable insights for your client.
Build interactive dashboards in Metabase
